# Enhanced JSON Columns

Support for JSON columns was introduced in EF Core 7. You could query and update JSON columns. But there were some limitations. EF Core 8 adds some more advanced JSON capabilities.  We can now query JSON collections of complex objects.

## Use Cases

- Use JSON columns to store complex objects/arrays
- Removes previous limitations of JSON queries
