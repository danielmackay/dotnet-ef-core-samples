# Primitive Collections

Primitive Collections allow us to store a list of primitive values in a column WITHOUT having to create a separate table.  EF Core will automatically do this for any primitive collections on our entities.  This doesn't require any special configuration.

## Use Cases

- Keep DB Schema clean without having to create unneeded tables for primitive collections
